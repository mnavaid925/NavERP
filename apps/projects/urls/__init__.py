"""Projects URLconf package — one sub-package per NavERP sub-module, one module per entity.

Each entity module exposes its own ``urlpatterns``; this __init__ sets ``app_name = "projects"``
once and concatenates them.

Django is first-match-wins: within each module the literal routes (`add/`) precede the
``<int:pk>/`` ones, and every first segment (``""`` — the root, i.e. the module landing page
``projects:overview`` — then ``project-requests/``, ``projects/``, ``stakeholders/``,
``kickoffs/``) is a distinct whole component.

No route in this app uses a converter in its FIRST path component — every first segment is a
literal — so no module can shadow another's namespace. That invariant is what makes the guarantee
hold, and it is the reason ``projects/`` (the charter register, mounted at ``/projects/projects/``)
does not collide with the app's own mount point.
